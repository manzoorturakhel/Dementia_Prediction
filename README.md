this project is about developing deep learning models for predicting dementia using MRI images and deploying these 
models into a web application with integrated XAI techniques to introduce interpretability and
trustworthiness of the deep learning models.


## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Git**: Version control system to clone the repository.
- **Python 3.8+**: Required for the Flask backend.
- **Node.js and npm**: Required for the React frontend.
- **pip**: Python package installer.

## Cloning the Repository

To clone the repository, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/manzoorturakhel/Dementia_Prediction.git
cd Dementia_Prediction




Setting Up the Backend (Flask)
cd backend

python -m venv venv
Activate the Virtual Environment:

On Windows:

venv\Scripts\activate

On macOS/Linux:

source venv/bin/activate


pip install -r requirements.txt

flask run

Setting Up the Frontend (React)
cd ../frontend

npm install

npm start   / npm run dev


due to the size of the two model files they couldn't be uploaded to github 
download it from the following link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14aEQq9Y589CU7ZHDrlw8abkmDu1myyip
add both the files into backend repository
